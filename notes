To Do

* Make sounds fade in & out

* Reverb?
	See: https://stackoverflow.com/a/5319085
* Input box for the sliders
* Final UI
	* Top right info button
	* Image should be full screen
	* All buttons & sliders in a panel bottom
* Dropdown of images
* Drag and drop images
* Upload button for images so it works on phones

* Put image onto oscilliscope

* Make the image decay somehow?

* Remove drawing code


Name ideas:

* Image Drone
* Drone Generator
* The Sound of Sight



* Vary the sound
	my variables are x/y/ (r/g/b) or (h/s/l)
	detune, phase, vary over time?
* Is ther ea difference between just playing osc's and triggerAttack() ?
	Instead of just changing immediately, the sound fades in and out
	depending on how many frequencies it has?
What if every stroke is an independent sound? Others fade out slowly

* Dropdown of images, including images with pure notes
	What would a harmonic series look like? 
* Slider to cycle through components of the image?
* Entropy checkbox







* What if my thing generates audio from images...and then I link to satellite imagery or webcams and listen TO THE EARTH


BIG IDEA: what if instead of selecting window, you are like painting, visible areas add tot he sound

Theramin notes
--------------

It works by detecting changes in an electromagnetic field??? So you can tune it by, having it play a note at the end of a scale when your fingers are closed, and beginning of scale when your fingers are open. ANd slowly open them to play across that scale.

That's fucking wild! Imagine building something like that. The instrument is really complicated, but consistent. What sounds can we find in the universe.
