To Do

* Split the image into 100x100 chunks, get the frequencies of each
	That gives you frequencies from 0 to 10k
	Along with an x/y
	Maybe even r/g/b?
* 



* Extract the RGB values of the area clicked on?
* Convert to DCT
* Then convert to sound frequencies
* Then play those? 


* Add drag and drop
* Visualize coefficients in a histogram?
* Convert list of DCT's to frequencies
	Given a list of N numbers
	let N = 20000 (highest frequency)
	for index i, it is the weight of frequency: Math.round( (i / N) * 20000)

	OK, now you have a list of frequencies you can play. 

	So then you can move your mouse to move a window 
	mouse wheel to expand or contract this window
	(multiple windows?)

	click and hold to play. Double click to make it sustained



* What if my thing generates audio from images...and then I link to satellite imagery or webcams and listen TO THE EARTH


BIG IDEA: what if instead of selecting window, you are like painting, visible areas add tot he sound

Theramin notes
--------------

It works by detecting changes in an electromagnetic field??? So you can tune it by, having it play a note at the end of a scale when your fingers are closed, and beginning of scale when your fingers are open. ANd slowly open them to play across that scale.

That's fucking wild! Imagine building something like that. The instrument is really complicated, but consistent. What sounds can we find in the universe.
